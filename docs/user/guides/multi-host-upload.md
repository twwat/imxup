## Tips

- **Test first** - Use the Test Connection button before uploading
- **One at a time** - If a host fails, try uploading to just that host to debug
- **Check credentials** - Most failures are due to expired API keys or wrong passwords
- **Premium accounts** - Some hosts require premium status for uploads
